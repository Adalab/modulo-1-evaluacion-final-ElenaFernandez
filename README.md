# Final Evaluation Module 1.

Hello! Here I have created the repository with the final evaluation of the module, in which, they asked us to make a web page based on the Adalaber web starter kit.
To make this web page, I have used Html, Sass, node and gulp.
In the exercise, they asked us several requirements that we had to meet:
- Use Sass.
- Use Grid.
- Use Flexbox.
- Use transitions.
An in adittion, we can use also animations in CSS.

Here you hve the direction of my web page.
